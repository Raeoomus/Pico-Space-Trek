# Pico-Space-Trek
A port of the game Space Trek by Jake Commander for the TRS-80 Color Computer that appeared in Color Computer Magazine in May 1983 to the ClockworkPi PicoCalc.

Unfortunately, I am unaware of a PicoCalc emulator at this time.

## Notes
Currently uses PicoMite MMBasic Version 5.09.00RC5

Still very much a work in progress.
All the technical challenges should be solved not all systems working yet. A lot of nightmares untangling the GOTO hell of the original.
